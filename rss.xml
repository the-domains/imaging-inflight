            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Science Fiction to Reality: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h1><p>What was once just a figment of the imagination of some our most famous science fiction writers, artificial intelligence (AI) is taking root in our everyday lives. We're still a few years away from having robots at our beck and call, but AI has already had a profound impact in more subtle ways.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/357196ae30863a53e7710f55ebbdd64acab6cdce.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

My body aches, my head is pounding, and my throat feels like it might fall out of my neck. Right now, though, I'm riding in the Tesla Model 3, one of the most hotly anticipated cars in the world...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7072e2c8eecfad7b01c2532650be669c8647d676.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Disney space station? It no longer seems like such a goofy idea</h1><p>Throughout our planet's space-faring history, there have been two major impediments to putting a lot of private citizens into orbit. Only governments have had spacecraft, and there have been only a few, government-controlled, space stations to visit. But now that may finally changing in a big way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d83d67a7d53a5e25e15266ea03dab94cba53ee33.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sevenhugs' Smart Remote</h1><p>Looking to simplify the endless number of apps and interfaces used to control smart-home products, French start-up Sevenhugs has introduced the first "contextually aware" universal Smart Remote. In other words, it's the first remote to understand where it is in your home and what it's pointing at, allowing users to simply point and click to control devices instead of switching between apps.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/df1caa77bd36920224edf22d445e863c5b829e80.jpg"></article>]]></description>
